    <h2>Card 3: But ‚Äî Why Do Companies Sell Shares?</h2>
    <p>
      You might be wondering, ‚ÄúWhy would a company sell a piece of itself to someone like me?‚Äù
      Well, here‚Äôs the simple answer: To raise money!
    </p>
    <p>
      When a company needs money to grow, launch new products, or expand, it sells shares of itself to investors like you and me. 
      This process is called an Initial Public Offering (IPO).
    </p>
    <p>
      ‚ö†Ô∏è Companies can also raise money through loans, private investors, or issuing bonds ‚Äî but an IPO is how they invite everyday people to invest and become part-owners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let‚Äôs say Paytm, a popular fintech company, wants to expand its services across rural India and develop new financial products. 
      To raise the money for that, they might decide to sell shares to the public.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you buy a share, you‚Äôre giving Paytm some cash to help it grow. 
      In return, you get a piece of the business!
